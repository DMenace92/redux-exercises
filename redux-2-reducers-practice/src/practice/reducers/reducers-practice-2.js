  Export a reducer that will manages an array of groceries. It must expect the following action types:
    - ADD_GROCERY
    - FETCH_GROCERIES
    - REMOVE_GROCERY
*/

// Theoretically, these action type labels would be imported from an actions file, but we will define them here in this case.
let ADD_GROCERY = 'ADD_GROCERY'
let FETCH_GROCERIES = 'FETCH_GROCERIES'
let REMOVE_GROCERY = 'REMOVE_GROCERY'
